# Checkers app

This is a mini checkers app(4x4), where two players can play this game online. A user can sign up/log in, they are redirected to lobby where they can create a new checkers game and wait until second player will join it, or join the game from the list(if there is any).

## Deployed Application

This app is deployed on heroku, feel free to check it [here](https://checkers-not-chess.herokuapp.com/).

You can log in with the `username: janedoe` and `password: password`, open new private browser window(to have two windows open), sign up with new account, and mimic the two player interaction in the lobby and game pages.
